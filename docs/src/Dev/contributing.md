# How to Contribute

We're always happy to welcome work with additional collaborators and contributors. One
of the easy ways for newcomers to contribute is by adding additional relaxations.

If you're interested in contributing in larger ways, please contact:
[**Robert Gottlieb**](https://psor.uconn.edu/person/robert-gottlieb/)

If you have any requests for additional functionality, bug fixes, or comments,
please feel free to open a new issue using the Github [**issue tracker**](https://github.com/PSORLab/EAGO.jl/issues).
